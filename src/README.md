## Quick Start

1.  Download third-party dependencies (see setup.m for details).
2.  Update matlab's search path (run setup.m from within Matlab).
3.  Run unit tests (run "runtests" from within Matlab after navigating into the "tests" directory).  If everything is working properly all tests should pass.
4.  Run demos/examples (see the "examples" subdirectory).  Of interest might be
    *  *demo_gabor.m*  A quick demonstration of how to use the Gabor transform codes.
    *  *demo_sift_and_pooling.m*  Provides examples of how to run SIFT on images and pool the resulting feature maps (in the context of a synthetic classification problem).
	*  *demo_multiclass_classification.m*  An example of using multiple transforms and pooling strategies to classify images.
