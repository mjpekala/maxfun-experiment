## Quick Start

1.  Download third-party dependencies (see setup.m for details).
2.  Update matlab's search path (run setup.m from within Matlab).
3.  Run unit tests (run "runtests" from within Matlab after navigating into the "tests" directory).
4.  Run experiments (see the "experiments" subdirectory).  For now, the only experiment is "classification_experiment_1.m".
