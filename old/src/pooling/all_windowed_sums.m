function Z = all_windowed_sums(X, wVals)
% ALL_WINDOWED_SUMS  Uses an integral image to compute
%                    all "windowed" sums of an image.
%
%      Z = all_windowed_sums(X, wVals);
%
%    where:
%      X     := an (m x n) image
%      wVals := a vector of window width values
%
%      Z    := a tensor where Z(:,:,ii) is the result of convolving
%              an averaging filter of width(ii) over the entire
%              image X.  Each Z(:,:,ii) contains the valid 
%              part of this convolution; the remainder is zero so
%              that all "slices" have the same size.
